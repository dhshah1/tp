### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/ui/Ui.java)

[![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MainDisplay`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that 
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Job`, `Mail`, `Contact`, `Product`, `Template`, `History` 
  objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. `StateManager` checks to see whether the parsed command can currently be executed depending on the current state of the application. 
    If it can the `Command` object is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object. 
6. For certain commands `StateManager` intercepts this `CommandResult` object. It communicates with model to perform extra operations and modifies the 
   `CommandResult` accordingly.
7. The `CommandResult` object is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("addJob c/1 p/1 d/Fix...")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addJob c/1 p/1 d/Fix...` Command](images/job/AddJobSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

### Adding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Adding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This Contact created is stored internally using 
`UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCrm` object.  
Additionally, `addContact` allows to have only partially info of a client with consideration of privacy. Commands
such as `AddContact n/xxx e/xxx` `addContact n/xxx c/xxx` are all acceptable.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addContact` command behave when executed by a user: 

![](images/contact/AddContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Adding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/contact/AddContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `AddContactCommandParser#parse`, `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a name using 
"Sans", `ParserUtil#parsePhone` to create a phone using "83921823", `ParserUtil#parseEmail` to 
create an email using "Sans@gmail.com", `ParserUtil#parseAddress` to create an address using "Maxwell...".  
Then create a contact using the new name, phone, email and address.

Note that `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, are optional, but at least one of these 3 fields
must exist.

![](images/contact/AddContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Editing a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Editing a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism reads and modifies a target contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `editContact` command behave when executed by a user:

![](images/contact/EditContactActivityDiagram.png)

![](images/contact/EditContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `EditContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).
- `EditContactDescriptor` will only get the values of `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, and `Tags` 
if their respective prefixes are present.
- `isHidden` is will not be handled by `EditContactDescrptior`, it will be updated in `createEditedContact`.

`EditContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the target contact's index and
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`: "Frisks", "88888888", "Frisks@gmail.com"
and "Jurong West" from the command string respectively.

![](images/contact/EditContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Contact

![](images/contact/DeleteContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `DeleteContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).
- The contact specified to be deleted must have no jobs linked, otherwise error message will be displayed in UI panel.

`DeleteContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ParserUtil#parseIndex` to get the target contact's index to delete it.

![](images/contact/DeleteContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Finding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Finding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism finds specific list of contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object with certain keywords provided.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `findContact` command behave when executed by a user:

![](images/contact/FindContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Finding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/contact/FindContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)


Within `FindContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Keywords` must be presented. (At least one trim of String)

`FindContactCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` and `String#split` to get list of keywords
in order for MyCRM to find corresponding contacts with these keywords as predicate.

![](images/contact/FindContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Hiding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Hiding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by the `MyCRM`. It hides a specific contact
which is visible only when user types the command `listContact -a`. Hidden contact will be tagged as `Hidden`.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `hideContact` command behave when executed by a user:

![](images/contact/HideContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Hiding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/contact/HideContactParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `HideContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).

`HideContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ParserUtil#parseIndex` to get the target contact's index to hide it.

![](images/contact/HideContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undoing Hiding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Undoing Hiding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by the `MyCRM`. It will unhide a hidden contact in list. Users are
required to type in command `listContact -a` in order to see **hidden** contacts.

Implementation and usage details for **Undoing Hiding a Contact** are similar to [Hiding a Contact](#hiding-a-contact) design
pattern. Can refer to `hideContact` command implementation details.
#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `undoHideContact` command behave when executed by a user:

![](images/contact/UndoHideContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Hiding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/contact/UndoHideContactParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `UndoHideContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `listContact -a` must first be typed in to see hidden contacts.
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).

`UndoHideContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ParserUtil#parseIndex`

![](images/contact/UndoHideContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Listing Contacts

#### Implementation

The **Listing a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism lists all unhidden Contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object by default. If `listContact -a` is invoked,
`MyCRM` will list all contacts including not hidden ones.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `listContact` command behave when executed by a user:

![](images/contact/ListContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Listing a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/contact/ListContactParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `ListContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Keywords` is optional but if provided, it can only be **"-a"**.
- If correct keyword is presented, contact list will show all contacts including hidden contacts.
If not, by default `listContact` will only show not hidden contacts in contact list.

`ListcontactCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` to get specific keyword.

![](images/contact/ListContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Adding a Template

#### Implementation

The Adding a Template mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This template created is stored internally using
`UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object. 

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/AddTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Adding a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/AddTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for 
`AddTemplateCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline 
reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Within `AddTemplateCommandParser#parse`, `ParserUtil#parseSubject` will be called to create a subject using 
"Completed", `ParserUtil#parseBody` to create a body using "Dear customer..." and create a template using the new
subject and body.

![](images/mail/AddTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

Additionally, before adding the new template into `Model`, `Template t` will be checked if a similar copy exist
within `Model`. The conditions required is:

* If both templates have the DO NOT same `Subject` content i.e. there is an existing template with subject "Completed".

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Unique Template**

* Current choice: Unique by Subject
  * Pros: Easy to understand and differentiate templates
  * Cons: Does not allow for different variations of general / common email headers i.e. "Completed" subject header 
    cannot be reused with different body content based on scenario
* Alternative: Unique by Subject and Body
  * Pros: Enables different variations of general / common email headers
  * Cons: May not be user-friendly as it may be hard to differentiate templates as some may be too similar at first 
    glance. Such as, minor typos, copy and paste with a couple of different words. Higher risk of confusion.    

### Editing a Template

#### Implementation

The Editing a Template mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism reads and modifies a target template 
object from `UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `editTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/EditTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Editing a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/EditTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `EditTemplateCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of templates).
- `EditTemplateDescriptor` will only get the values of `Subject` and `Body` if their respective prefixes are present. 

`EditTemplateCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the specified template index and 
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract both `Subject` and `Body`: "Completed" and "Order Completed!" from the 
command string respectively.

![](images/mail/EditTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Template

#### Implementation

The Deleting a Template mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This template removes a target template object from
`UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `deleteTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/DeleteTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Deleting a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/DeleteTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `DeleteTemplateCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of templates) and at least one field to be edited, for the mechanism to
  execute successfully.
- `ParserUtil#parseIndex` will be called to extract the index of the specified template to delete.

![](images/mail/DeleteTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

### Finding a Template

#### Implementation

The Finding a Template mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism finds specific list of template object 
from `UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object with certain keywords provided.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `findTemplate` command behave when executed by a user:

![](images/mail/FindTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Finding a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/FindTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `FindTemplateCommandParser#parse`,
-  At least one keyword must be presented.
-  Keyword specified must be whole word.

`FindTemplateCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` and `String#split` to get list of keywords
in order for MyCRM to find corresponding templates with these keywords as predicate.

![](images/mail/FindTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

### Constructing an Email

#### Implementation

The Constructing an Email mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This email is constructed based of the information 
from a specified job and template from `UniqueJobList` and `UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object. A mailto URL 
will be generated, sending users to their default mailing application with details of the job and template. 

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `mail` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/MailActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Constructing an Email mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/MailParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `MailCommandParser#parse`,
- `JobIndex` must be is valid (within the range of job).
- `TemplateIndex` must be is valid (within the range of templates).
- `ParserUtil#parseIndex` will be called to extract both the index of the specified job and template to mail.

![](images/mail/MailSequenceDiagram.png)

An additional feature of constructing an email is the generation of a mailto URL, allowing for users to transfer 
their job and template details to the user's default mailing application.

Given below is an example of the generation of a mailto URL:

![](images/mail/MailUrlSequenceDiagram.png)

After the URL is generated, the URL string is passed to a JavaFX `Hyperlink` object that when clicked, will execute 
the URL path.

### Adding a Product

#### Implementation

The **Adding a Product** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This product created is stored internally using
`UniqueProductList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addProduct` command behave when executed by user:

![![Activity diagram of add product](images/product/AddProductActivityDiagram.png)](images/product/AddProductActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

![![Sequence diagram of add product](images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram.png)](images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram.png)

**Parse user input**

Within `AddProductCommandParser#parse`, the **factory methods** of product components (`getProductName` and 
`getEmptyProductName` for product name, `getType` and `getEmptyType` for type, ...) will be invoked to create product
component objects: name, type, manufacturer, description. 

**Note**: Name is *compulsory* for creating a product, whereas type, manufacturer and description are *optional* fields.

![![Sequence diagram of parse user input](images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)

### Editing a Product

#### Implementation

The **Editing a Product** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism first reads the target product object from 
`UniqueProductList`, then creates a new product object with <u>user input fields</u> and <u>unchanged fields of target 
product</u>. Lastly, it replaces the target product with the new one, updates its references in jobs, and updates UI.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `editProduct` command behave when executed by user:

![![Activity diagram of edit product](images/product/EditProductActivityDiagram.png)](images/product/EditProductActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

![![Sequence diagram of edit product](images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram.png)

**Parse user input**

Within `EditProductCommandParser#parse`,
* EditProductCommandParser will only get the values of fields(`name`, `manufacturer`, `type`, `description`) if their 
  respective prefixes are present.

`EditTemplateCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the specified product index and 
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract product name “Asus” and description “DisplayPort, HDMI” from user input 
respectively.

![![Sequence diagram of parse user input](images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)

**Updates product references in jobs**

After target product is replaced with new product, `EditProductCommand#execute()` will traverse job list and replace
references to target product with references to new product.

To get the full job list, `EditProductCommand#execute()` will first store the *lastest predicate* of job list, set the 
predicate to "show all jobs". After traversing the job list and updating the references, the *latest predicate* is 
restored.

<u>Design Consideration</u>: An alternative way to get full job list is to retrieve the underlying `UniqueJobList` through
`Model`. `EditProductCommand` is implemented in the other way as directly accessing and modifying `UniqueJobList` leads to an
association between `EditProductCommand` and `UniqueJobList`, which increases coupling.

![![Sequence diagram of parse user input](images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Sync.png)](images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Sync.png)

### Adding a Job

#### Implementation
The **Adding a Job** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. Similar to other entities like products or contacts, jobs created 
are stored internally using`UniqueJobList` inside the `MyCrm` object. The job entity holds a reference to exactly one contact entity
and one product entity. As such, the key consideration behind this feature was to provide users an easy and flexible way
to be able to assign either existing or new product/contact to the job being added. 

To assign existing product/contact to the new job, the users can provide a index that corresponds to the product/contact
in their respective displayed lists. This functions similarly to other commands that use an index to identify an entity. 
e.g `editContact, deleteContact, etc...`.

As an alternative, users can choose not to provide the contact/product index when adding a job. The job creation process will not 
be completed until it is assigned both a product and a contact. Instead, the application will remember that a job's creation process
is incomplete and that it needs a contact and/or product assigned to it. The user can then follow up with commands to add a new
contact and product, and they will be created and automatically linked to the job. Once the job is assigned both a contact
and a product it is added to `MyCRM`. 

This functionality is managed by `StateManager`. This is how it works:
1. It maintains a list of states the application is in. e.g If a `addJob` command is issued without a contact index, `StateManager`
   will remember that a job is being added, and needs a contact assigned to it.
2. Each state has a corresponding list of allowed commands that are permitted in that state. e.g When a contact is being assigned 
   some commands that are allowed are `addContact`, `listContact`, etc...
3. When a command is executed, the state manager might intercept its `CommandResult`, to perform additional operations. 
   e.g After an `addContact` command, if a job is currently being added, state manager will link it to the job. 
   The `CommandResult` will be modified before it is returned

#### Usage
