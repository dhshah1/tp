MyCRM is a **desktop application for managing client contacts, repair job statuses, and product information that has
been optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you type quickly, MyCRM can complete customer relationship management tasks faster than traditional GUI
applications.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the
   app contains some sample data.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`listContacts `** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`addContact `**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact
     named `John Doe` to the MyCRM Book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence
  of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `listJobs`, `listProducts `, and `exit`
  ) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `listJobs 123`, it will be interpreted as `listJobs`.

### Adding a job: `addJob`

Adds a new repair job to the CRM.

Format: `addJob d/DESCRIPTION n/CLIENT_NAME p/PRODUCT_NAME [by/DELIVERY_DATE]

Possible follow up commands:

* `select [n/CONTACT_INDEX] [p/PRODUCT_INDEX]` (if multiple matching names for existing contacts and products)
* `select [n/NEW] [p/NEW]` (if user  proceeds with creation of new contact and product)

* Creates a new repair job.
* If the client name and product name provided correspond to existing contacts or products they will 
  automatically be linked to the repair job. 
* If not the contact and product entities will be created with just their name. 
  More contact/product specific details can be added subsequently using their respective commands.
* In the case there happen to be multiple clients or products with the same name,
  a list of client names and product names will be shown for the user to select from. 
  The command `select n/CONTACT_INDEX p/PRODUCT_INDEX`  will be used to select the specific contact and product, 
  where `CONTACT_INDEX` and `PRODUCT_INDEX` refer to the index in the contact and product listing.
* However, if user wishes to actually create new contacts or products instead of choosing existing matching ones 
  they can issue the command `select n/NEW p/NEW`
* Note: Any combination of the select commands is valid.  
  Commands like `select n/CONTACT_INDEX` (if there is no matching existing products) or 
  `select n/NEW p/PRODUCT_INDEX` (if user wants to create a new contact but reuse an existing product) are valid.

Examples:

* `addJob d/Graphics card replacement needed n/John Doe p/Asus GPU by/15/09/2021`
* In the case there happen to be multiple existing clients or products with the
  same name, their listings are shown:
